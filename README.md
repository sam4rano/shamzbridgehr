Create an engaging human resource landing page using Next.js or React.js. The page should include the following key features: a Navbar, a Hero Section, an About Us section detailing our mission and vision, a Services section, and a Footer.

Note: your work should be responsive across all devices.

Utilize a color palette of blue, white, and slate for a fresh and modern look.
